# Interactive-Form
Using JavaScript to create an interactive registration form for a fictional conference.

Adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity.
Validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields

Real-Time Error Messages
On all required fields, I added real-time validation errors that listen to the user input and display errors if the input doesn't match the desired pattern.
For instance, in the name field, if the user enters a number, the error displays so that the user deletes that to enter a character. When they enter characters, 
the check icon shows that their input is valid.

Conditional Error Message
